## Abstract:
The scope of this research is to determine if there is any correlation between the level of experience of surgeons and their visual attention while performing surgeries. Data was gathered by Dr. Sofia Lyford-Pike and her team. 18 surgeons at the University of Minnesota performed surgeries while using Pupil Labâ€™s mobile eye-tracking glasses. By analyzing the position, velocity, and acceleration of the pupils, a percentage of focus was computed. Using different statistical models, it was determined that senior surgeons are more visually focused than junior surgeons.
